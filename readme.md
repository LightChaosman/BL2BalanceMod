## Goal

Revamp the BL2 experience.
Similar to the UCP, the goal is to add more variety to the game.
Unlike the UCP, the balance patch does not nescesarily strive to maintain vanilla feel, nor does it exclude nerfs.

Extremely broken stuff from the main game will be nerfed, weak stuff will get buffs or be replaced by something new.
